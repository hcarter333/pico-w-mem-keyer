    <p>The app provides keyer sidetone on key down. As you key, it maintains two histograms: the one on top, (blue bars), 
    measures the the lengths of your dits and dahs; the one on bottom, (green bars), measures the length of your pauses between dits and dahs, your pauses between letters, 
    and your pauses between words.</p>
